# What is ReVamp?

## Mission:
ReVamp keeps the user’s experience and wallet in mind. Our goal is to provide a high quality photo editing service and make it as accessible, affordable and flexible as we possibly can.

For the average user who needs basic image filtering, ReVamp is a web application that will provide a convenient interface to process images. The system will maintain and provide customers with basic image processing needs. This system will contain a collection of premade filters ready to apply to any image. Unlike the current, competition paid features will be free to use.
